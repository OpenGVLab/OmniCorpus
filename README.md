## Introduction

OmniCorpus dataset is the largest multimodal dataset to date, which pushes the boundaries of scale and diversity by encompassing 8.6 billion images interleaved with 1,696 text tokens from diverse sources, significantly surpassing previous datasets.
This dataset demonstrates several advantages over its counterparts:

1. **Larger data scale:** Our dataset is 1.7 times larger in images and 12.5 times larger in texts compared to the previously largest multimodal dataset, LAION-5B, while maintaining excellent data quality.
2. **Richer data diversity:** Drawing from a broader range of data sources, our dataset is more diverse than other image-text interleaved datasets. It includes bilingual multimodal data in both Chinese and English, and encompasses text-centric and vision-centric documents extracted from common websites and video platforms.
3. **More flexible format:** The streaming data format of our dataset offers exceptional flexibility, allowing adaptation to various data structures, including pure text corpora, image-text pairs, and interleaved data formats.

The OmniCorpus contains three sections:

- **[OmniCorpus-CC](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/OmniCorpus-CC)**: processed from dumps in Common Crawl from 2013 to Nov./Dec. 2023.
- **[OmniCorpus-CW](https://openxlab.org.cn/datasets/Li-Qingyun/OmniCorpus-CW)**: sourced from Chinese internet resources, will be availiable in OpenDataLab platform.
- **[OmniCorpus-YT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/OmniCorpus-YT)**: samples Youtube video frames as images and collects subtitles as texts.

The image-text interleaved documents are recommanded for the following usages:

- Pre-training multimodal large language model (MLLM): Recent MLLMs (such as Flamingo series, EMU series, IDEFICS series, MM1, Cambrian-1, and xGen-MM) have shown that image-text interleaved data aids multimodal in-context learning and maintains the capabilities of large language models during multimodal fine-tuning.
- Long text-image retrieval: We provide image-text similarities calculated with CLIP, which can convert the documents to image-text retrieval dataset with longer text. A retrieval model pre-trained on such data can retrieval images based on longer text, which can be used for multimodal RAG, converting pure text to multimodal sample, etc.
- Source for futher dataset research: Our data is large-scale, which can serve as the source for researches for data curation strategies. We provide many useful attributes as metadata for each document, which can enrich the filtering strategy and reduce the cost.

## Data Pipeline

Our data pipeline consists of five key stages: main body extraction, preliminary text filtering, document deduplication, image downloading \& filtering, and detailed text filtering. Each stage efficiently reduces the dataset to retain only high-quality data.
Please refer to our paper for more details about the data pipeline.

## Experimental Results

We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of OmniCorpus. As shown in the table below, model trained on our dataset demonstrates superior performance on academic caption and vqa benchmarks.
Please refer to our paper for more experimental results.

> (2024.10): We've updated the results with a [stronger pre-trained model](https://huggingface.co/Qingyun/OmniCorpus-InternVL).
