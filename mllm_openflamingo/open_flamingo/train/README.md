# OpenFlamingo Training
To train OpenFlamingo, please ensure your environment matches that of `environment.yml`.

## Data
Our codebase uses [WebDataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset) to efficiently load `.tar` files containing image and text sequences. We recommend resampling shards with replacement during training using the `--dataset_resampled` flag. 

### LAION-2B Dataset
[LAION-2B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08402) contains 2B web-scraped (image, text) pairs. 
We use [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) to download this dataset into tar files.

### Multimodal C4 Dataset
We train on the full version of [Multimodal C4 (MMC4)](https://github.com/allenai/mmc4), which includes 103M documents of web-scraped, interleaved image-text sequences. During training, we truncate sequences to 256 text tokens and six images per sequence.

Our codebase expects `.tar` files containing `.json` files, which include raw images encoded in base64.
We provide scripts to convert MMC4 to this format: 

1. Download the MMC4 shards into `.zip` files using [the MMC4-provided scripts](https://github.com/allenai/mmc4/tree/main/scripts) (e.g., `fewer_facesv2.sh`).
2. Download the MMC4 raw images into an image directory using [the MMC4-provided scripts](https://github.com/allenai/mmc4/tree/main/scripts) (e.g., `download_images.py`).
2. Run `scripts/convert_interleaved_to_wds.py` to convert the downloaded items into the expected tar files.

### ChatGPT-generated sequences
A subset of our models (listed below) were also trained on experimental ChatGPT-generated (image, text) sequences, where images are pulled from LAION. The shards containing these sequences can be found at [this CodaLab worksheet](https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0xdcd888ff7c754ae680c5e038f6ed1d9b). We are unable to distribute raw images in the released shards; images must be pre-downloaded from the urls in the json files and converted to base64 before using this data for training in our codebase.

Models trained with ChatGPT-generated sequences:

* OpenFlamingo-4B-vitl-rpj3b
* OpenFlamingo-4B-vitl-rpj3b-langinstruct

## Example training command

```
*Note: The MPT-1B [base](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-1b-redpajama-200b)  and [instruct](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-1b-redpajama-200b-dolly) modeling code does not accept the `labels` kwarg or compute cross-entropy loss directly within `forward()`, as expected by our codebase. We suggest using a modified version of the MPT-1B models found [here](https://huggingface.co/anas-awadalla/mpt-1b-redpajama-200b) and [here](https://huggingface.co/anas-awadalla/mpt-1b-redpajama-200b-dolly).*

## Distributed training

By default, `train.py` uses Pytorch's [DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html) for training. 
To use [FullyShardedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html), use the `--fsdp` flag. 

Some notes on FSDP:

* We recommend using the `--fsdp_use_orig_params` flag. If `--fsdp` is on without this flag, all language model embeddings will be unfrozen during training. (In contrast, the default behavior is to only train the newly added `<image>` and `<|endofchunk|>` tokens.)
    * Note: we've encountered issues using OPT with this flag. Other language models should be compatible.
* Our current FSDP wrapping strategy does not permit training language model embeddings that use tied weights (i.e., tied input / output embeddings). To train such models with FSDP, the language model embeddings must be frozen with the `--freeze_lm_embeddings` flag.

We also implement gradient checkpointing and mixed precision training. Use the `--gradient_checkpointing` and `--precision` arguments respectively.
