  <body><h2>Welcome to Round Table Gauteng</h2><p>Did you know that the best young men’s organization in the world was founded in February 1927? That’s right, Round Table was created after the Duke of Windsor gave a speech urging young business and professional men to get together around a table and improve themselves and their communities.</p><p>Round Table is a club specifically designed for young men between 18 and 40 (45 in some countries) years old, regardless of their beliefs or political opinions. It’s an exclusive club, but anyone can join if they’re invited by a current member who will then become their sponsor.</p><p>Round Table is not just any ordinary club, it’s a voluntary non-political, non-denomination non-profit organization. It’s all about meeting new people, exchanging ideas, and developing friendships. With approximately 30,000 members worldwide, Round Table is an international organization that promotes fellowship and community service.</p><p>As a member of Round Table, you’ll have the opportunity to give back to your community by raising funds through various events and lending a hand wherever it’s needed. You’ll also have the chance to involve your family, allowing your kids to learn important values and grow alongside you.</p><p>Our motto is Adopt, Adapt, Improve, and we strive to foster growth in all areas of our lives. We aim to develop fellowship among young men through their professional and business occupations, while emphasizing that one’s calling offers an excellent medium of service to the community. We cultivate the highest ideals in business, professional, and civic traditions, while recognizing the worthiness of all legitimate occupations.</p><p>Round Table fosters responsible citizenship and loyalty to our country, while furthering the establishment of peace and goodwill in international relationships. We achieve these goals through meetings, lectures, discussions, and other activities.</p><p>Our logo, the Rondel, is a circular object that symbolizes equality. Each seat around the table is equal, and everyone has an equal voice. The original disc that inspired the logo is over 4 meters in diameter and was likely used as a table. The center of the logo features the Tudor’s rose, which was the emblem of the Tudors from 1450 on, and above it, a king with his scepter, possibly King Arthur.</p><p>So, if you’re a young man looking for a way to make a difference in your community while making new friends and developing yourself, consider joining Round Table. Adopt, Adapt, Improve – it’s not just our motto, it’s a way of life.</p><p>Round Table raises funds through either organizing various fund-raising events, or by offering time and energy to give a hand wherever it’s needed. As with any hobby, you certainly get out of it what you put in.</p><p>This personal commitment certainly also offers a wider experience: Round Table is used to involve families, where our kids can learn to spend time together, sharing our values and growing in similar aspects in life as the Tablers themselves do.</p><h2>Aims and Objectives</h2><p>These are the goals that we strive for together – to foster growth across all levels</p><ul><li>To develop fellowship among young men through the medium of their professional and business occupations .</li><li>To emphasise the fact that one’s calling offers an excellent medium of service to the community.</li><li>To cultivate the highest ideals in business, professional and civic traditions.</li><li>To recognise the worthiness of all legitimate occupations and to dignify each his own by precept and example.</li><li>To foster responsible citizenship and loyalty to our country</li><li>To further the establishment of peace and goodwill in international relationships</li><li>To further the above objects by meetings, lectures, discussions and other activities.</li></ul><p>Our Motto is Adopt, Adapt, Improve.</p><h2>The Rondel</h2><p>Where it comes from and what it means</p><p>The first Round Table (Norwich, England) adopted the proposal from Neville Headon from RT Manchester: a drawing inspired by a wooden disc which can still be admired in the Great Hall in Winchester (England).</p><p>In its centre, we can see the “Tudor’s rose” which was the emblems of the Tudors from 1450 on; just above we can see a king (which could be the King Arthur) with its sceptre.</p><p>As this original disc is more than 4 metres as diameter, it seems it was used as a Table. This is why the 2-colors-radius all around remembers that every seat around the Table is equal.</p><p>This logo was taken over by RT Britain and Ireland while chartering their national association in 1928. This general theme was then taken over by each new association. King Arthur and / or the central rose was replaced each time by a symbol that refers to the relevant national association.</p><p>View our Social media below to follow us.</p><graphic src="https://roundtablegauteng.co.za/wp-content/plugins/wd-facebook-feed/images/loading.gif"/></body>
